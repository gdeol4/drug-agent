ADME Property Prediction Task Overview
Definition: A small-molecule drug is a chemical and it needs to travel from the site of administration (e.g., oral) to the site of action (e.g., a tissue) and then decomposes, exits the body. To do that safely and efficaciously, the chemical is required to have numerous ideal absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties. This task aims to predict various kinds of ADME properties accurately given a drug candidate's structural information.

Impact: Poor ADME profile is the most prominent reason of failure in clinical trials. Thus, an early and accurate ADME profiling during the discovery stage is a necessary condition for successful development of small-molecule candidate.

Generalization: In real-world discovery, the drug structures of interest evolve over time. Thus, ADME prediction requires a model to generalize to a set of unseen drugs that are structurally distant to the known drug set. While time information is usually unavailable for many datasets, one way to approximate the similar effect is via scaffold split, where it forces training and test set have distant molecular structures.

Product: Small-molecule.

Pipeline: Efficacy and safety - lead development and optimization.

Absorption
Absorption measures how a drug travels from the site of administration to site of action.

PAMPA is a non-cell-based, low-cost and high-throughput alternative to cellular models.

Task Description: Binary classification. Given a compound's SMILES string, predict whether it is has high permeability (1) or low-to-moderate permeability (0) in PAMPA assay.

Dataset Statistics: NCATS set - 2035 compounds; Approved drugs set - 142 drugs.

Drug-Target Interaction Prediction Task Overview
Definition: The activity of a small-molecule drug is measured by its binding affinity with the target protein. Given a new target protein, the very first step is to screen a set of potential compounds to find their activity. Traditional method to gauge the affinities are through high-throughput screening wet-lab experiments. However, they are very expensive and are thus restricted by their abilities to search over a large set of candidates. Drug-target interaction prediction task aims to predict the interaction activity score in silico given only the accessible compound structural information and protein amino acid sequence.

Impact: Machine learning models that can accurately predict affinities can not only save pharmaceutical research costs on reducing the amount of high-throughput screening, but also to enlarge the search space and avoid missing potential candidates.

Generalization: Models require extrapolation on unseen compounds, unseen proteins, and unseen compound-protein pairs. Models also are expected to have consistent performance across a diverse set of disease and target groups.

Product: Small-molecule.

Pipeline: Activity - hit identification.

BindingDB
Dataset Description: BindingDB is a public, web-accessible database of measured binding affinities, focusing chiefly on the interactions of protein considered to be drug-targets with small, drug-like molecules.

Note: BindingDB is the collection of many assays. Since different assays use different metrics, TDC separates them as separate datasets. Specifically, it has four datasets with Kd, IC50, Ki as the units.

Tips: Transforming to log-scale pIC50, pKi, and pKd can usually lead to more stable training. You can achieve this transformation via here. Checkout the data processing page for binarization, label distribution visualization, edge list/DGL/PyTorch graph transformation.

data = DTI(name = 'BindingDB_Kd')
# data = DTI(name = 'BindingDB_IC50')
# data = DTI(name = 'BindingDB_Ki')
split = data.get_split()
Note: Many DTI pairs have same sequence information but different binding affinities due to different experimental assays. To harmonize them, you can use the below function to retrieve either the maximum affinity or the mean for the duplicated pair:

from tdc.multi_pred import DTI
