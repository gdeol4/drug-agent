Part 1: Generating Protein Embeddings with Pretrained Models

Description:
This section demonstrates how to generate protein sequence embeddings using pretrained models through the ProteinFeaturizer class with the esm method. These embeddings are helpful for various downstream tasks such as protein classification, regression, and similarity search. The ESM (Evolutionary Scale Modeling) model generates 1280-dimensional embeddings, which represent protein sequence features learned from large datasets.

How to Use:

Import the ProteinFeaturizer class:
from agent_tools import ProteinFeaturizer

Create a ProteinFeaturizer object with the esm method:
featurizer = ProteinFeaturizer(method="esm")

Use the ProteinFeaturizer object to generate embeddings for a protein sequence:
sequence = "MKTAYIAKQRQISFVKSHFSRQ"
embedding = featurizer(sequence)

Example:
from agent_tools import ProteinFeaturizer

Initialize the featurizer with the ESM method
featurizer = ProteinFeaturizer(method="esm")

Generate embeddings for a protein sequence
sequence = "MKTAYIAKQRQISFVKSHFSRQ"
embedding = featurizer(sequence)

print(embedding) # Output: A numpy array representing the embedding with shape (1280,)
