Your task is to design and train a model using the PAMPA dataset for the ADMET task. The dataset includes three files: train.csv, val.csv, and test.csv, all located in the same directory as train.py. Each file contains a drug ID, a drug represented as a SMILES string, and a corresponding Y label.
This is a binary classification problem where the Y label has two possible values, 0 and 1. 
You are required to complete the train.py script by implementing the logic to train a model. Experiment with different models and feature selection techniques to achieve better performance.
Evaluate the model's performance using roc-auc as the primary metric. Once you are satisfied with the performance, use the test dataset to generate predictions probabilities and save the results in a file named submission.csv.
Ensure that the changes you make to the script are tested and executed to verify their performance. Do not directly read any CSV files in your implementation.
Note: non-deep learning models typically work better in this task.
